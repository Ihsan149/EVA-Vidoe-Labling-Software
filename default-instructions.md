Welcome to our Video Mapping Tool.

Your task is to accurately draw rectangles around people in each video. We need this so that we can train a computer to understand people's location indoors from a fisheye lenses.

## Quick Instructions
1. Draw a box accurately around a person (covering every part you can see)
2. Hit 's' to go step through frames
3. Adjust the box to keep it accurate
4. Go back to the first frame and repeat for the next person


For example:

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `a` step back 1 frame
- `s` step forward 1 frame
- `space` play/pause
- `d` or 'delete' to delete selected rectangle

## Detailed Instructions
1. We need you to draw an accurate box around each person you see in the video
2. We recommend you draw *one* person at a time from each video end to end and then rewind to the start for the next person
3. Best way to do this is frame by frame - hit 's' to move to the next frame and 'a' to move backwards 1 frame
4. You can skip frames when a person does not move. You will see a dotted line around that person.
4. If you don't see any people in the video for that frame then don't draw any rectangles
5. If the person disappears then delete the rectangle that represented that person (press 'd', or 'delete' with the box selected)

## Bonus Payment
1. The time to complete one HIT will depend on the number of people in the frame and the amount of movement.
2. As such we will pay a bonus of $0.02c per accurate frame mapped.
3. Note if the person does not move at all or if the dotted rectangle is accurate, please do NOT create a rectangle in that frame. We will reject the HIT if you do this.

## How accurate do you need to be?
We require a tight rectangle covering all of the person visible in that video frame.
